        <p>
          I am a front-end developer. I have a bachelor degree in "Telecommunications Science
          & Technology" at the University of Peloponnese and I had the chance to learn the basics of Programming: C, Java,
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
          My internship at think.gr SA (Information
          Technology & Services - Software development Company) gave me
          the opportunity to gain a detailed overview and experience on web development, graphic design, hosting and support of websites.
          I always to find ways to learn new technologies and extend my
          knowledge in Programming and also in Web Design. I am dedicated, positive, hard-working and willing to
          learn.
          I am looking forward to further develop my skills and knowledge in Programming
          and gain experience in Web Development & Design. My goal is to become a great,
          constantly-evolving developer, with creative thinking in order to find innovating ideas
          and solutions to the problems of the programming field.
